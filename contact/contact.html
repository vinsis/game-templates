I neither have time nor adequate resources to implement everything on my own. <br><br> • I need collaboration with like-minded people. If you want to join me or have something that may interest me, shoot an email. <br><br> • If you have a question, a comment, a critical remark or just a small advice, shoot an email.</p> <p align="center">I will be happy to hear from you. </p>
