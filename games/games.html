<h3>Welcome! </h3><p>Games are the soul of this whole undertaking. </p><p>There are different kinds of games for learning different kinds of characters. Some games demand sound logical analysis and a basic knowledge of characters. Some games require a good knowledge of how characters are formed to be played. But there is always an ounce of logic in every game to keep your brain ticking.

<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td><td><b>Directions</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../2aEvolve/evolveV1.html">Evolve - V1</a></td>
<td>A game for learning characters which are created by combining a lot of smaller characters. They look formidable and convoluted at first sight, but once you know the smaller characters forming a bigger character, it just becomes a matter of arranging blocks in the right fashion.</td>
<td>Use arrow keys to navigate the player. The game is intuitive, and you will get the hang of it as you try it out.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../2bEvolve/evolveV2.html">Evolve - V2</a></td>
<td>Similar to Evolve V1 in concept, but the canvas has a few walls which restrict the movement of blocks.</td>
<td>Use arrow keys. The player initially can pass through any wall until it hits a block.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../quads/quads.html">Quads</a></td>
<td>A mathematical game to practice quick calculation.</td>
<td>Use arrow keys. The radius of the circle is proportional to its distance from the moving line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../bubbles/bubbles.html">Bubbles</a></td>
<td>Co-ordination game; slightly chance based. </td>
<td>Use arrow keys to keep the player under one of the circles all the time. The player has limited time outside the bubbles. Target is to reach a circle in one of the corners. I will modify this game later to include some language learning content as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../3aColors/colors.html">Color Swap</a><br><a href="../gamedemos/colors/colors.html">Demo</a></td>
<td>A game where you need to swap colors of the canvas to make a character visible in the foreground. It invokes recognizing morphological similarities between characters and using them to create a character.</td>
<td>Click on the area which has the color that you want to swap. Then click on another area you want the color to swap with. The colors will get swapped immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../3bLinju/linju.html">Neighbors</a><br><a href="../gamedemos/linju/linjuDemo.html">Demo</a></td>
<td>My favorite game so far. I made this game as an attempt to simulate how human settlements take birth. You need to recognize the neighbors in the game based on a given criteria and then put them side by side in a way that maximizes the attractiveness of the 'settlement'.</td>
<td>Identify which blocks should be put together. Then click on the block in the right canvas and then click in a grid on the left canvas where you want to place the block. The aim is to gather as many points as possible by structuring the layout of the blocks. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../4aMen/door.html">Itinerary</a><br><a href="../gamedemos/men/menDemo.html">Demo</a></td>
<td>A game created for characters whose shapes have a common element. The player needs to pass through ever region in the canvas by changing its character.</td>
<td>Use arrow keys to move the player and bump it into a block to change its character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../5liar/liar.html">Lying Pigs</a></td>
<td>A game where you need to guess the right character based on statements given by three pigs.</td>
<td>Click on each pig to see the statements given out by them. Based on your analysis, answer the question on the same page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../6phonetics/phony.html">Phonetics</a></td>
<td>A game to learn and practice the logic behind phonetics and radicals. You need to recognize the characters based on their meanings and pronunciation.</td>
<td>Try to get a picture of each character by clicking on the brown blocks and 'Hints' button. Then click the blocks on the right canvas and then click on the relevant block.</td>
