	<p>The game is fairly simple to play. The figure below is divided into certain areas. You just need to swap the colors between two areas to create another image.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The figure below shows the areas colored in different colors. But in the game, you will have all portions painted in the same color with a black border. </li>
	<img src="images/im0.png"></img>
	<li>Click inside a portion you want to change the color of. The background of text "Last Color Chosen" will then change to the color of the area you just clicked in.</li>
	<img src="images/im1.png"></img>
	<li>Click on the area you want to swap the colors with. The colors will swap immediately. The images below show how it is done.</li>
