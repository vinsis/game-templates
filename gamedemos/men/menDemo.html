<h3>Men2</h3>Men2 means door. I didn't think much before naming this game.
<p>Another easy to understand game for learning characters that follow a regular pattern.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The canvas is divided into different sections, each having a different color and a moving player. The moving player can't enter any of the inner blocks unless it changes the character it displays.</li>

	<li><i>A player can change the character it displays by colliding into a relevant block. </i></li>
	<img src="images/im2.png"></img>
	<img src="images/im3.png"></img>
	<li>Each section has a name (pinyin for a character). The player can enter a section only if the character it displays matches the pinyin of that section.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Aim:</strong>Your aim is to devise a path so as to cover all the sections of in the canvas. Once you have covered all the blocks, you will be greeted with a message.<p><br><img src="images/im4.png"></img>
